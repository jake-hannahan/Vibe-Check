> > [W14:D3] 29 March 2023 | Wednesday

<!---------------- WEEK 15 ---------------->

> > [W15:D4] 6 April 2023 | Thursday
> > As a team, we completed the front-end sign-up form. We also installed React-Router-Dom, built the skeleton for our navbar, and began coding the main page. We also included some placeholder css styling for our pages until we decide on a proper theme for our website.

> > [W15:D5] 7 April 2023 | Friday
> > Decided to take a more chill approach to working today as a group. We decided what remaining components were necessary to complete our MVP, stepped through each component's logic so that we were on the same page as a team, and decided to work on coming up with our app theme/design style over Spring Break so that we can come back and go straight into pair programming each component.

<!---------------- WEEK 16 ---------------->

> > [W16:D1] 17 April 2023 | Monday
> > As a team, ran Flake8 to refactor and clean up backend code.
> > I coded for the day but we collaborated as team. We refactored our create a vibe query so that it calls the create a playlist function first before creating the vibe. We then began discussing our application's visual theme and design.

> > [W16:D2] 18 April 2023 | Tuesday
> > As a team, we made the main page carousel card and song list card components. We also began working on redux for our vibe data. We then decided on how to navigate our remaining work for the upcoming week so that we can finish with enough time to review our work before project submission.

> > [W16:D3] 19 April 2023 | Wednesday
> > Worked on the Vibe Detail page. Found embedded Spotify player and changed SongList component to use that code instead.
